# Bash-Scripts

Developed a set of bash scripts to automate daily tasks, including creating a to-do list, User and Group Management
and organizing files.

## Network Monitoring
a Bash script designed to monitor network connectivity for specific domains. The script reads domain names from a file or accepts domain names as input parameters, and then performs a ping operation to gather network information. This information is then inserted into a PostgreSQL database.
